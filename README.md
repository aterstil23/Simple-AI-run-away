# Simple-AI-run-away
Simple AI to make an object run away from a moving object that is controlled by user input.
It's only working for 1 object running away from another. 
Try to imagine how to make the object run away from multiple objects.

video that i watched to use the library GLFW in visual studio

There are two versions up to date.
One with only key input to make the chaser move (arrow keys).
One with either key input (arrow keys) or mouse input(click the target location you want the chaser to go to) to make the chaser move.
